When life hits you hard
You'll either be sad or just get mad.
And sometimes it makes you think,
What if you will just sink?
Will they be able to notice?

You did your best just to fit in
Only to find out it wasn't worth it.
All that's left is an ugly scar
And a question: 'what made you go this far?'

**soundless scream and silent cries**

Disappear for quite awhile
Take some time to heal your heart.
Then find a place and start anew.
Take it slowly and just be you.

Never attempt to live again
On the shadow of anyone else
Discover your own identity 
In hands of the Almighty.

Though this road seems less traveled by,
Take it anyway and give it a try.
A journey that you'll never regret 
'Cause it will bring out your very best.

Every step is surely worth it
No matter how difficult it may seem.
So, keep going and persevere
Hold unto Him and trust His will.

Then sooner you'll realize,
This world is nothing without Christ.
The place you longed for in this world
Is not even a glimpse of what your future holds!
