Once, my life is so unpredictable 
Somewhat, somehow, I'm so irresponsible 
I've done worst things out of curiosity
Just to show them my capability

I also felt like I'm disable
And it seems like everything is impossible 
Obstacles came from time to time
So I just chose to run and hide

For all those times i was in trouble
Until you came, the best but so humble
You opened my eyes and lights up my lost world, 
To let me see you... my beautiful Saviour and Lord! 

I never thought of life like this 
Even in tough times there is bliss.
Storms and thunders may come swiftly
But it cannot take the peace in me. 

You told me that the journey is not easy
But You promised to be there for me
So each time that i fall, i just look back on the cross
Then i stand up and keep going 
Because i know that You are waiting. 

My life was never the same 
Since the day you intervened
You let me know that I am destined
To be with You in eternity!
